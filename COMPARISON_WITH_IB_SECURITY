Landlord vs IB Security - Comparison points

- Landlord makes it easy and consistent to a) find out your scope, b) query with no scope
- Landlord has fewer LOC and complexity- Security is (299+148+64 = 501) Landlord is (102+35+17 = 157), though expected to grow
- Landlord has a cute naming convention
- Landlord does not intercept or hack any ActiveRecord methods
- Landlord just says 'NO' to SQL string concatenation
- Landlord defines the partitions in a configuration file: 
    partition :owner_id,   :references => 'Owner#id'
    partition :published,  :values => [true, false]

- Landlord is inherently flexible, not tied to any preconcieved partitioning schemes                          
- Landlord lets you make an explicit mapping of an HTTP request to security parameters
    partition :owner_id,   :references => 'Owner#id', 
                           :http_initializer => lambda{|req| Owner.find_by_name(req.host.split('.').first).id}
    
- Landlord owes alot to the work of Tim G and all who helped make IB Security work as well as it does. 
- Landlord may or may not be applicable to the complex user permissioning clauses - haven't evaluated that yet, suspect we may not want to do that in the DB anyway.
