Landlord vs IB Security - Comparison points

- Landlord makes it easy and consistent to a) find out your scope, b) query with no scope
- Fewer LOC in Landlord - Security is (299+148+64 = 501) Landlord is (102+35+17 = 157), though thats expected to grow
- Landlord has a cute naming convention (which means you'll actually be able to remember how it works)
- Landlord does not rely on intercepting rails calls - it just populates the data structures that rails calls use - no rails methods are actually overridden ! 
- Landlord defines the partitions in a configuration file, so is generalizable
- Landlord validates the settings given to it
- Landlord does not do SQL concatenation
- Landlord lets you make an explicit mapping of an HTTP request to security parameters
- Landlord owes alot to the work of Tim G and all who helped make IB Security work as well as it does.
